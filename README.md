# FinalProject-Group8
Currently, the FinalProject-Group8 repository contains five folds. 
The Code fold contains all the code related to the final project. 
The Final-Group-Presentation contains the Powerpoints slides for the final presentation.
The Final-Group-Project-Report contains the report of the project. 
And the Group-Proposal contains the proposal of the Project, which illustrates the experiment plan and the schedule.
Besides, there is a temp_draft fold, which will contain all the resources we find and some semi-finished codes. It will be deleted when we submit the whole project.
